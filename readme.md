# KSSB-Menu-Telegram

[Kansas State School for the Blind's Food menu](https://kssb.net/parents/menu) was sometimes annoying to navigate to; especially if you are lazy like myself.

This bot aims to run on a server somewhere, and request the week's menu for you. Takes a few seconds, rather than like 30.

## Usage
As the user, all one must do is type '/menu' into it and it will obtain it for you.

## Final notes
For more information (including initial work on obtaining the menu) see the [KSSB-Menu repo itself](https://github.com/kssb-cc/kssb-menu).
